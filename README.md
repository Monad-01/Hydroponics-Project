# Smart Hydroponic Monitoring System

## Overview

Welcome to the Smart Hydroponic Monitoring System repository! This cutting-edge project utilizes software and hardware integration to provide real-time insights into hydroponic environments, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth.

## Features

- **Advanced Sensor Integration**: Utilizes DHT20 and TDS sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the nutrient solution.

- **Data Visualization**: Real-time data is elegantly displayed on an LCD screen, offering a visually appealing interface for monitoring temperature, humidity, and TDS levels.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular sensor readings are processed and logged, providing detailed analytics for precise control over nutrient concentration.

## How It Works

The system employs Arduino-based firmware to interface with sensors and displays. It takes advantage of software algorithms to process data efficiently and provide accurate readings, fostering an environment conducive to optimal plant growth.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Connection**: Connect the DHT20 sensor for temperature and humidity, the TDS sensor for nutrient concentration, and an LCD screen to the Arduino board following the provided schematics.

2. **Code Deployment**: Upload the sophisticated Arduino sketch (`Hydroponics-Monitoring.ino`) using the Arduino IDE, showcasing your proficiency in firmware development.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Power up the system to experience the seamless integration of hardware and software, providing real-time insights into hydroponic conditions.

## Repository Structure
